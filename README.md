## Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet entertaining game for two players, typically played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol (either "X" or "O") on the grid.

## How to Play
1. Run the game.
2. Players take turns entering their moves.
3. Enter the row and column where you want to place your symbol.
4. The game checks for a win or a draw.
5. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6. If all cells on the board are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
